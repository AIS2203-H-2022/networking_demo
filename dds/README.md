# DDS demo

This folder contains sources in C++ and Python for both DDS publishers and subscribers.

The C++ code relies on [fast-dds](https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/), 
while the Python code relies on [Ecliplse CycloneDDS](https://cyclonedds.io/docs/cyclonedds-python/latest/index.html).

You need to manually install CycloneDDS before running the python code:
```bash 
pip install cyclonedds
```
